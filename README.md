# Lagless-FinalBurnNeo-Drivers-Porting-Project
# This is a Shmupmame's lagless drivers porting project！
As same as "Lagless-MAME-Drivers-Porting-Project",This project will port the Shmupmame's drivers(use memcpy to copy spriteram to mainram to remove the lag of sprites) to FinalBurn emulators,such as FBA and FBN
# WIP：
cave's lagless driver in C++ to FBN
psikyo's lagless driver in C++ to FBN
gp9001's lagless driver in C++ to FBN
